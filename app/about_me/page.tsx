        <a>Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Problem Solver<br/>
<br/>

<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Marcel Williams â€” a Software Engineer in Training with full-stack experience and a strong drive to build scalable, real-world web applications.</p>
  
  <p>Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the Chegg Skills (Thinkful) Software Engineering program, where Iâ€™ve been sharpening my skills in full-stack JavaScript development, with a particular focus on the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). With a solid background in technical roles and systems analysis, I bring both practical problem-solving skills and a collaborative mindset to every project.</p>
  
  <p>Before transitioning into tech, I spent over a decade in field service and systems management roles at AT&T and TXU Electric Delivery, where I honed skills in technical troubleshooting, data analysis, and communication. These roles have shaped my ability to approach engineering tasks with a user-first, reliability-focused mindset.</p>

  <br/><br/>
ðŸ’¡ What I bring to the table:
<ol className="pr-5 text-left">
    <li>âœ… Full-stack development with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>âœ… Strong backend API design with Express and SQL using Knex.js</li>
    <li>âœ… Responsive, component-based front-end UIs built with Tailwind CSS and Zustand</li>
    <li>âœ… Former tech lead experience, troubleshooting fiber networks and optimizing systems</li>
    <li>âœ… Continuous learner with hands-on training in agile development and test-driven coding</li>
  </ol><br/>

 Recent Projects:
<ol>
<li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>PERN Stack Store</strong> â€“ Full-stack e-commerce platform with user auth, API, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS</li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Study Tool App</strong> â€“ Flashcard study application with spaced repetition using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Library App</strong> â€“ A book search and review platform developed with vanilla JS and Node.js</li>
</ol><br/><br/>
Iâ€™m excited about opportunities in software engineering, where I can contribute my skills and grow alongside talented professionals. Letâ€™s connect and chat about tech, development, and career growth!
